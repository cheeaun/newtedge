Newt Edge
===

**Newt Edge** is my very old 2003/04-ish CSS experiments web site. It first appeared on [`phoenity.com/newtedge`](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602201839/http://www.phoenity.com/newtedge/) (Phoenity.com was an old domain of mine for my icons artwork). Then it moved to `cheeaun.com/newtedge`. And now it's here.

I probably have forgotten parts of its history now, tho I remember it was pretty popular back then. It was [mentioned by Anne van Kesteren on mezzoblue.com](http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/06/25/mose/#c016127). It's also [mentioned on Roger Johansson's article](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200306/catching_up/). It was featured on a book too called [CSS Hacks and Filters: Making Cascading Stylesheets Work](http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0764599976.html).

The name 'Newt Edge' was inspired by Eric Meyer's [css/edge](http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/).
